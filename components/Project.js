                This is a  blog application but we need to host it on vercel.
                This project took a short time to finish but the developer was doing some family work
                that make it take a longer time. The project is a awesome one üòÅ as I look carefully to
                select needed packages and they are streamlined for optimization because a large file size 
                impedes performance.

                Let me handle your project and I promise that you will recommend me to your friends and
                colleages for similar or different jobs.
